# taskrail-feature

Follow the `taskrail` skill's procedure; this skill defines the stages. If the feature proves
too large for a short plan, say so at the plan gate instead of writing a long one; the human
may split it into several tasks.

## plan — gate: always

Write the artifact with these sections:

- **Behaviour** — what the user or caller can do afterwards.
- **Acceptance criteria** — numbered, each one testable.
- **Affected areas** — modules, interfaces, data.
- **Out of scope**.
- **Open questions and risks**.

Commit it. At the gate, the human approves the plan.

## implement — gate: always

1. Write tests for each acceptance criterion, then the implementation.
2. Run the stage's checks.
3. In the artifact, map each acceptance criterion to the tests that cover it.
4. Commit. The gate is a code review.

## verify — gate: conditional

Exercise the feature in its real runtime — the running application, the CLI, the API — not
only through tests. Record what you did and what you saw. Stop at the gate only if the
behaviour differs from the plan.
